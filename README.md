NewsReaderLondon-Hackathon
==========================

Codes created for NewsReader London Hackathon on 10 June as part of team 'Fail fast, fail often'

NewsReader (http://newsreader-project.eu/) is a EU-funded project from a consortium, made up of 
- VU University Amsterdam
- Universidad Del Pais Vasco (University of the Basque Country)
- Fondazione Bruno Kessler 
- LexisNexis (Netherlands)
- ScraperWiki
- SynerScope

After almost two years of research and work, the consortium held a hackathon on 10 June, 
held at the Hub Westminster in London. Other attendees included the members from BBC News Lab.

'Fail fast, fail often' was made up of myself and 
- German Rigau from University of the Basque Country
- Julian, from ScraperWiki
- Yow Tzu, programmer in a London based investment bank 
- Rajeev, programmer

We were named 'Fail fast, fail often' because the projects we wanted to do in our group
didn't pan out, so we had to keep pivoting and try out new ideas. 
Of course, it didn't help that most of us were novice programmers 
with little experience using and playing with linked data. 
Nevertheless, we tried our best with...

- Analysis 1: What are news articles saying about footballers and cars? 
(Codes: http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/cecilialiao/NewsReaderLondon-Hackathon/blob/master/Analysis%201%20-%20Footballers%20and%20cars.ipynb)
- Analysis 2: What are news articles saying about national football teams?
- Analysis 3: What are the purchases (and sales) happening in the world of World Cup?
(Codes: http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/cecilialiao/NewsReaderLondon-Hackathon/blob/master/Analysis%203%20-%20Buy%20Events.ipynb)

I summarised our work in this slidedeck (https://github.com/cecilialiao/NewsReaderLondon-Hackathon/blob/master/Presentation.pptx) and presented to the group, netting us a second prize made up of international snacks, including Spanish ham, Dutch biscuits, and British sloe gin.
